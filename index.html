          Today I had hoped we would get to work with some sensors, but it seemed everyone needed some help working with funciton implementation. Tomorrow I'll try to spend around 30 minutes reviewing how to make and use functions with some more analogies and examples. Afterwords, we'll work with some sensors, electronics and (hopefully) start saving data that we collect!
